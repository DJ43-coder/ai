🎯 Problem Statement
Implement a solution for Prim’s Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm as a greedy search algorithm, as per Assignment No: 03 (Laboratory Practice II), which focuses on greedy algorithms (e.g., Selection Sort). The goal is to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph, with user input for graph construction.

🔍 1. What is Prim’s Algorithm?
📌 Definition:
Prim’s algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a weighted, undirected graph. It starts from a user-specified vertex and grows the MST by repeatedly adding the smallest-weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside it.

👨‍💻 In This Context:
- Variables: Vertices and weighted edges of the graph.
- Goal: Construct an MST with minimum total edge weight.
- Constraint: The MST must connect all vertices without cycles, using exactly V-1 edges (V = number of vertices).
- Input: User provides vertices, edges, edge weights, and starting vertex.

🖼️ 2. What is a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?
An MST is a subset of edges in a weighted, undirected graph that:
- Connects all vertices (spanning).
- Forms a tree (no cycles).
- Has the minimum total edge weight among all possible spanning trees.

✅ Real-world Applications:
- Network Design: Minimizing cable length in telecommunications or electrical grids.
- Clustering: Hierarchical clustering in data analysis.
- Approximation Algorithms: Solving NP-hard problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem.
- Transportation: Optimizing road or pipeline networks.

🧩 3. Core Concepts and Algorithms Used
🔷 A. Greedy Approach in Prim’s Algorithm
- Definition: Prim’s algorithm makes locally optimal choices (selecting the minimum-weight edge at each step) to achieve a globally optimal MST.
- Steps:
  1. Start with a user-specified vertex.
  2. Add the minimum-weight edge connecting the MST to an unvisited vertex.
  3. Repeat until all vertices are included.
- The greedy choice ensures no cycles and minimizes total weight.

🔷 B. Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix)
- We use an adjacency matrix constructed from user input:
  ```python
  graph = [[0] * vertices for _ in range(vertices)]  # Initialized with zeros
  graph[u][v] = weight  # Set weight for edge (u, v)
  graph[v][u] = weight  # Undirected graph
  ```
- Each entry graph[u][v] represents the weight of the edge between vertices u and v (0 if no edge).
- Suitable for dense graphs and simplifies edge weight lookups.

🔷 C. Priority Queue (Min-Heap)
- Uses Python’s `heapq` module to efficiently select the minimum-weight edge.
- Stores tuples of (weight, vertex) to prioritize edges with smaller weights.

📊 4. Complexity Analysis
⏳ Time Complexity:
- Using a binary heap (via `heapq`):
  - Heap operations: O(E log V) for edge updates (E edges, each with a log V push/pop).
  - Vertex processing: O(V log V) for extracting vertices.
- Total: O((V + E) log V).
- With an adjacency matrix, checking neighbors is O(V) per vertex, but the heap dominates.

💾 Space Complexity:
- O(V) for the visited, key, and parent arrays.
- O(V) for the priority queue.
- O(V²) for the adjacency matrix.
- Total: O(V²) due to the matrix.

⚙️ 5. How the Code Works (Flow Summary)
Step | Description
-----|------------
1    | User inputs number of vertices, edges, and starting vertex.
2    | Initialize an adjacency matrix with zeros.
3    | User inputs edges (u, v, weight); populate the matrix bidirectionally.
4    | Initialize data structures: visited array, parent array, key array, priority queue.
5    | Start with the given vertex (key[start_vertex] = 0, push to queue).
6    | While the priority queue is not empty:
7    | Pop the vertex with the minimum edge weight.
8    | If unvisited, mark it visited, add its edge to MST, update total weight.
9    | Check neighbors; update key/parent for unvisited neighbors with smaller edges.
10   | Print the MST edges and total weight.

- Constructs an adjacency matrix from the input.
- Calls prim_mst to compute the MST.

"""📌 9. Viva-Style Questions and Answers
1. **What is Prim's algorithm, and how is it a greedy algorithm?**
   - Prim’s algorithm finds an MST by repeatedly adding the minimum-weight edge connecting the MST to an unvisited vertex. It’s greedy because it makes locally optimal choices without reconsidering them.

2. **How does the priority queue improve Prim’s algorithm?**
   - The priority queue (min-heap) allows efficient selection of the minimum-weight edge, reducing the time complexity from O(V²) to O((V + E) log V).

3. **What is the time complexity of this implementation?**
   - O((V + E) log V), due to heap operations (O(E log V) for updates, O(V log V) for extractions).

4. **Why use an adjacency matrix instead of an adjacency list?**
   - The adjacency matrix simplifies edge weight lookups (O(1) vs. O(E) for lists) and is suitable for dense graphs or small inputs, as in this implementation.

5. **What happens if the graph is disconnected?**
   - Prim’s algorithm assumes a connected graph. For disconnected graphs, it would only find the MST for the component containing the start vertex.

6. **How does the key array work in Prim’s algorithm?**
   - The key array stores the minimum edge weight to reach each vertex from the MST. It’s updated when a smaller edge is found.

7. **Why skip visited vertices in the priority queue?**
   - Visited vertices are already in the MST, so their entries in the queue are outdated and should be ignored.

8. **What are the applications of Prim’s algorithm?**
   - Network design (e.g., minimizing cable length), clustering, and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.

9. **How does Prim’s algorithm ensure no cycles in the MST?**
   - By only adding edges to unvisited vertices, it maintains a tree structure, preventing cycles.

10. **Can Prim’s algorithm handle negative edge weights?**
    - Yes, as long as the graph is connected, since it selects the minimum-weight edge regardless of sign.
