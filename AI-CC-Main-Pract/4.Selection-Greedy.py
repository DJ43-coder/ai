üí° Greedy Algorithm

üî¢ Selection Sort

üìà Time and Space Complexity

‚ôªÔ∏è In-place and Stability Concepts

üë®‚Äçüè´ How Greedy Strategy Applies to Selection Sort

üß™ Real-world Analogy

üìò THEORY: Selection Sort using Greedy Algorithm
1. ‚úÖ Greedy Algorithm: Concept
A Greedy Algorithm is a method of solving problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step, with the hope that this leads to a globally optimal solution.

üîë Characteristics:
Makes immediate best (greedy) decisions.

Does not reconsider previous choices.

Works best for problems where a local optimum leads to a global optimum.

2. üî¢ Selection Sort: Concept
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts:

The sublist of items already sorted

The remaining sublist of items yet to be sorted

The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning of the unsorted part‚Äîthis is where the greedy approach is applied.

3. üß† How Greedy Algorithm Is Applied in Selection Sort
In each iteration:

Greedy Choice: Pick the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted portion

Place it in its final position (sorted portion)

This decision is local and immediate, without backtracking

This satisfies the principle of a greedy algorithm.

4. ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity of Selection Sort
Case	Comparisons	Swaps	Time Complexity
Best Case	n(n-1)/2 comparisons	O(n) swaps	O(n¬≤)
Worst Case	n(n-1)/2 comparisons	O(n) swaps	O(n¬≤)
Average	n(n-1)/2 comparisons	O(n) swaps	O(n¬≤)

The number of comparisons does not change based on input order.

So, time complexity is always O(n¬≤).

5. üì¶ Space Complexity
O(1) ‚Äî constant space

It uses only a few extra variables (like min_index, i, j)

So, it is an in-place sorting algorithm

6. üîÅ In-Place vs Stable Algorithm
üß© In-Place:
Selection sort does not use extra memory ‚Äî it modifies the array directly.

‚öñÔ∏è Stable:
Selection sort is NOT stable.

Equal elements may be swapped and lose their original order.

Example:

text
Copy
Edit
Input: [4a, 4b, 3]
Output: [3, 4b, 4a]  ‚Üê not stable
7. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è Ascending vs Descending Order
Ascending: Greedily pick the minimum element and place it at the front.

Descending: Greedily pick the maximum element and place it at the front.

8. üåç Real-life Analogy
Imagine you're selecting the shortest person from a group and asking them to stand first in line.

Then pick the next shortest from the remaining.

You continue doing this until everyone is arranged by height.
This is how selection sort (greedy) works.

üßæ Summary
Concept	Summary

Selection Sort	Repeatedly selects smallest/largest and moves it to sorted part
Time Complexity	O(n¬≤) for all cases
Space Complexity	O(1), in-place sorting
Stability	Not stable ‚Äî may change relative order of equal elements
Ascending Sort	Selects minimum from unsorted
Descending Sort	Selects maximum from unsorted
Greedy Strategy Usage	Greedy choice = picking best candidate (min/max) in each iteration



1. üî¢ Selection Sort
Working Principle:
Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

Steps:
Traverse the array and find the smallest element.

Swap it with the first unsorted element.

Repeat this process for the remaining unsorted part of the array.

Time Complexity:
Best, Worst, and Average Case: O(n¬≤)

Space Complexity:
O(1) ‚Äî It is an in-place sorting algorithm.

Advantages:
Simple and easy to understand.

In-place sorting ‚Äî uses constant space.

Performs well on small arrays.

Disadvantages:
Inefficient for large datasets with O(n¬≤) time complexity.

Not stable ‚Äî equal elements may not retain their original order.

Performs unnecessary swaps even when the array is already sorted.

Best Use Cases:
Small-sized arrays where the simplicity of implementation matters more than efficiency.

When memory usage is critical (since it uses constant space).

2. üîÑ Bubble Sort
Working Principle:
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Steps:
Compare each pair of adjacent elements.

Swap them if they are in the wrong order.

After each pass, the largest (or smallest) element "bubbles" to its correct position.

Repeat until the list is sorted.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)

Worst and Average Case: O(n¬≤)

Space Complexity:
O(1) ‚Äî It is an in-place sorting algorithm.

Advantages:
Simple to understand and implement.

Stable ‚Äî preserves the order of equal elements.

Works well when the input array is already nearly sorted.

Disadvantages:
Inefficient for large datasets (O(n¬≤) in the worst case).

A lot of unnecessary comparisons, even when the array is sorted.

Best Use Cases:
For small arrays or arrays that are already nearly sorted.

Educational purposes for learning basic sorting concepts.

3. üîÄ Insertion Sort
Working Principle:
Insertion Sort builds the sorted portion of the array one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position within the sorted part.

Steps:
Start from the second element and compare it with the elements before it.

Shift the elements larger than the current element to the right.

Insert the current element in its correct position.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)

Worst and Average Case: O(n¬≤)

Space Complexity:
O(1) ‚Äî It is an in-place sorting algorithm.

Advantages:
Adaptive ‚Äî works faster when the array is already partially sorted.

Stable ‚Äî maintains the relative order of equal elements.

Simple to implement.

Disadvantages:
Inefficient for large arrays with time complexity O(n¬≤).

May require a lot of shifting of elements in the worst case.

Best Use Cases:
For nearly sorted or small arrays.

When you need an adaptive sort that works well for arrays with small inversions.

4. üîΩ Merge Sort
Working Principle:
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges them back together.

Steps:
Divide the array into two halves.

Recursively sort each half.

Merge the two sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

Time Complexity:
Best, Worst, and Average Case: O(n log n)

Space Complexity:
O(n) ‚Äî It is not in-place and requires additional space for merging.

Advantages:
Efficient for large datasets due to O(n log n) time complexity.

Stable ‚Äî preserves the relative order of equal elements.

Handles large arrays better than quadratic algorithms like Selection or Bubble Sort.

Disadvantages:
Not in-place ‚Äî requires extra space proportional to the size of the array.

Slower than Quick Sort in practice due to higher constant factors.

Best Use Cases:
For large datasets where the efficiency of O(n log n) matters.

When stability is required.

5. üöÄ Quick Sort
Working Principle:
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

Steps:
Pick a pivot element from the array.

Partition the array into two sub-arrays: one with elements smaller than the pivot and the other with elements greater than the pivot.

Recursively sort the two sub-arrays.

Time Complexity:
Best and Average Case: O(n log n)

Worst Case: O(n¬≤) (occurs when the pivot is poorly chosen)

Space Complexity:
O(log n) ‚Äî in-place sorting with space required for the recursion stack.

Advantages:
Efficient on average with O(n log n) time complexity.

In-place sorting ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt require extra space like Merge Sort.

Works well on random data.

Disadvantages:
Not stable ‚Äî may change the relative order of equal elements.

Worst case is O(n¬≤), which happens when the pivot selection is poor (e.g., always picking the first or last element).

Best Use Cases:
For large datasets where average-case O(n log n) time complexity is acceptable.

When you want a fast, in-place sorting algorithm for random data.

üìä Comparison Summary
Algorithm	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Stable	In-place	Best Use Case
Selection Sort	O(n¬≤)	O(1)	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes	Small arrays
Bubble Sort	O(n¬≤) (worst)	O(1)	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	Nearly sorted arrays
Insertion Sort	O(n¬≤) (worst)	O(1)	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	Nearly sorted arrays
Merge Sort	O(n log n)	O(n)	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No	Large datasets
Quick Sort	O(n log n) (avg)	O(log n)	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes	Large datasets, random data

üéØ Conclusion
Selection Sort is easy to understand and in-place but inefficient for large arrays with its O(n¬≤) time complexity.

Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort are adaptive and work well for nearly sorted data but suffer from inefficiency with larger arrays.

Merge Sort offers stable sorting and works efficiently with large datasets but is not in-place.

Quick Sort is in-place and generally the fastest for random data but can degrade to O(n¬≤) if the pivot selection is poor.
